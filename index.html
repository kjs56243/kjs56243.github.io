    <h2 style="text-align:center"> Rules and Logistics </h2>
    <p> Epee is one of the three ways to fence. The name comes from the weapon used in this style of fencing, 
		a thicker blade with a wire running through it, as electrical systems are used to help keep score.
		When pressure is applied to the tip, a circuit is closed, setting off the scoring machine. In fencing,
		there is a concept called right of way, where competitors can only score if they have carried out certain
		actions, such as beginning an attack or blocking and riposting an attack. With epee, there are no 
		right of way rules, so fencers are free to move and score with whatever techniques they wish. Another
		unique aspect of epee is that points can be scored anywhere on the body whereas other weapons will only
		award points if they hit the conductive target areas. Below is a list of gear used in epee fencing.

 <h2 style="text-align:center"> <br>History </h2>
   	<p> The epee comes from light civilian weapons dating back to the 17th century that were used for dueling.
	The sword developed in the 1800's when the duels were fought to first blood, meaning a cut on the hand
	would suffice, thus leading to focus on touches to the arm and giving way to te modern rules of epee. Before
	the electric system was developed, the blades had pronged tips to snag on clothing and signal the touches, 
	and later on dyes.
